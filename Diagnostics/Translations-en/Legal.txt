Legal/&KickstarterDemoDisclaimerDescription	IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: YOU are aware that what you intend to download and play is a very early PRE-ALPHA DEMO of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game which is still under development. Be sure that OUR team is currently working hard to bring the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game to a whole new level. The PRE-ALPHA DEMO is made available for free for a limited period of time only. \n\nThe PRE-ALPHA DEMO is hand-crafted to give YOU an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game; the PRE-ALPHA DEMO may contain bugs on rare occasions. YOU are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on OUR website www.solasta-game.com. WE need to hear from YOU in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n\nSome rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO. For example, the surprise round is not implemented, readying an action is not yet possible, we are too liberal at swapping inventory items, and some spells and effects are missing. We will fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and as many rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the PRE-ALPHA DEMO but will be part of the final game: creating and leveling up a full party with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more.

Legal/&EarlyAccessDisclaimerDescription	Hey there folks! Welcome to Solasta - or more specifically, the Early Access of Solasta: Crown of the Magister. We really appreciate your support. You're all fantastic!\n\nPlease bear in mind that you are playing an Early Access version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister which is still under development. This Early Access version contains around 10 hours of gameplay and gives you access to the full Character Creation Tool with all ancestries, classes, and archetypes unlocked, with a level cap at level 6. The full 1.0 release will see a price increase and will deliver the entire main campaign of Solasta: Crown of the Magister, as well as many side quests for you to discover. \n\nWe have done our best to provide a strong and enjoyable experience. However, do note that the Early Access version may contain some occasional bugs. You are warmly invited to send us feedback, report any bugs and problems, or suggest improvements on our Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/uu8utaF) as well on our official forums (https://forums.solasta-game.com/). Our goal is to continue working hand in hand with our players to make a game that is representative of what our community wants. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to release the full version of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game that will include lots of additional features and content. \n\nConsidering the fact that game development is a very iterative process, please understand that your save files on the Early Access version will likely be incompatible with larger updates and with the full game release. As such, if you are looking for the complete experience the full version of Solasta: Crown of the Magister can offer, we encourage you not to purchase this Early Access version, but to wait for the release of the full game. Alright, enough reading - go enjoy the game!
