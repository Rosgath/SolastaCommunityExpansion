Deity/&MaraikeDescription	The goddess of life and death, the patron of healers and embalmers, and the embodiment of universal duality. Traditionally, she is Arun's wife. Her cult consists of two orders:\nThe Order of Life Regnant travels the land as healers and defenders. They worship the healing, motherly aspect of Maraike.\nThe Order of Oblivion is an order of avengers and embalmers. Where evil tries to pervert the cycle of life and death, the Order ensures that the culprits are dealt with, and their undead victims returned to their rest.

Deity/&MisayeDescription	The goddess of mischief, protector of rogues and swindlers, and patron of all those who chafe against rules and enjoy a little chaos. \nPriests of Misaye seldom live a relaxing life. Usually, they are one step ahead of the law - if they are lucky! Many lead a double life - normal citizens by day and priests of Misaye by night - because the cult of Misaye is outlawed in many nations and barely tolerated in most others.
