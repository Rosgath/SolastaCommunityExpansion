Marketing/&DisclaimerSteamFestivalDescription	You are aware that what you intend to play is a very early Alpha Demo of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game, which is still under development. Be sure that our team is currently working hard to bring Solasta: Crown of the Magister to a whole new level. We are also working on providing you with a fully working Character Creator, allowing you to create and level up a full party with an even wider range of options. The Early Alpha Demo is available for free for a limited period of time only. \n\nThe Early Alpha Demo is hand-crafted to give you an early taste of the Solasta: Crown of the Magister video game, it may contain bugs on rare occasions. You are more than welcome to share your feedback and report any problems or bugs on the Steam platform or directly on our website www.solasta-game.com. We need to hear from you in order to make a game that is representative of what our community wants.\n\nSome rules and features are missing or are not implemented in the Early Alpha Demo. For example, some spells and effects are missing. The Early Alpha Demo allows you to create a full party of characters using the Character Creator tool, but it will not breathe life into your heroes yet. We will of course fix this and try our best to integrate as much content and rules as possible for the final game. Some of the game features are also not demonstrated at all in the Early Alpha Demo, but will be part of the final game: leveling up a full party created with a wide range of options, playing through a campaign storyline, and much more.\n
